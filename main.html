		<h2>Quotes</h2>
		<p>I'll tell you a secret. Something they don't teach you in your temple. The Gods envy us. They envy us because we're mortal, because any moment might be our last. Everything is more beautiful because we're doomed. You will never be lovelier than you are now. We will never be here again.<b>:-Brad Pitt as Achilles</b></p>

	<h2>summary</h2>
	<p>Based on Homer's "Iliad," this epic portrays the battle between the ancient kingdoms of Troy and Sparta. While visiting Spartan King Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), Trojan prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) falls for Menelaus' wife, Helen (Diane Kruger), and takes her back to Troy. Menelaus' brother, King Agamemnon (Brian Cox), having already defeated every army in Greece, uses his brother's fury as a pretext to declare war against Troy, the last kingdom preventing his control over the Aegean Sea.</p>

		<h2>IMDb Ratings - :10/10 </h2>
		<h4>"Where does it end?" -- "It never ends."</h4>
		<p>If Homer's mythical epic "The Iliad" is based on a factual story, that story is magnificently depicted in Wolfgang Petersen's 2004 epic "Troy." In other words, don't expect any goofy 'gods' or 'goddesses' like Athena popping out of thin air because "Troy" is a realistic portrayal of the Trojan war.

			More than that, "Troy" is arguably the best sword & sandal epic ever put to film. You name the picture -- "Samson and Delilah," "Spartacus," "Ben-Hur," "Ulysses," "The Viking Queen," "Conan the Barbarian," "Braveheart," "Attila," "The Odyssey," "Gladiator," etc. -- "Troy" is superior. At the very least it's as good as some of the better flicks just noted, like "Ben-Hur," and far edges out "Spartacus" and "Samson and Delilah." As for more recent sword & sandal epics, like the overrated "Braveheart" or "Gladiator," "Troy" blows 'em out of the water.</p>
			<h4>"Gods envy men's mortality: myth is mutable"</h4>
			<p>Far better than I expected from its reputation and the critics. This is as lavish and enjoyable an old-fashioned film epic as I have seen, and much better than most. Epic is not an easy genre in which to satisfy the nit-pickers: it paints a story with broad strokes, and it's not difficult to find fault with smaller details. Things worth noting: the contrasting balance between the two sides seemed particularly well done. The Trojans were vaguely Asian or near-Eastern, and the Greeks were vaguely Germanic or Western. At the same time the armour and equipment of both were equally impressive, and more or less of an age. The Trojans were softer, more civilized and tender; the Greeks were rougher and tougher and more barbaric, but more effective --- and cunning. A civilized man is a city-dweller. The Trojans were citizens, the Greeks were rustics. In the end the cunning peasants won.

				The settings and fight scenes were terrific. Much of the acting was excellent, and Brad Pitt, especially, was extremely powerful. He comes over as a kind of cross between Schwarzenegger and Crowe; just a slight touch of the Neanderthal without seeming stupid. In fact, while watching, I kept thinking how real his Achilles was --- whether or not the man ever existed, three thousand years ago. Hector, who is presented as the honourable, civilized man, could have been a bit more rugged, in order to give greater stature to Achilles' opposition. The homo-erotic relationship between Patroclus and Achilles is glossed over, and does not convince. Patroclus doesn't look good enough, and calling him "cousin" fails to explain why Achilles gets so worked up about his death. I agree with those critics who felt there was insufficent physical chemistry between the protagonists, and some of the dialogue was a little clunky. There wasn't quite enough life in the passions between Paris and Helen, Hector and Andromache, Priam and his sons. On the other hand the Iliad itself is not about love, but centres on Achilles; his grimly fatalistic attitude, and his acceptance of a short, spectacular life instead of unmemorable longevity. This was very well presented, and strongly reminiscent of the Old Norse belief that the only thing that doesn't die is a famous name.
				
				The presence of the Gods was finely suggested: these ancient humans are in the grip of forces beyond their control. They are doomed by fate to act out their given roles: which the Gods have decided for them. Freedom and choice was illusory. It still is. As for "accuracy", as several viewers have pointed out, this is quite irrelevant, especially as the film never sets out to represent Homer's Iliad, line for line.
				
				Watching this adaptation for the second time, it is sinking in what a new, deeply interesting and creative take the writer has made on the prehistoric legends. Bad films often seem good, first time round, but repeated viewings reveal them to be shallow. Good films get better the more you watch. As time goes on, this re-interpretation will surely mature and improve, until its worth is recognized.
				
				Some reviewers have criticized the performances of Paris and Helen. I don't get it. The actress is beautiful, and that is all she has to be. She is merely the face that launched the thousand ships: the excuse for the war, not the real reason. Paris is a feckless playboy, a lover not a fighter, but a good archer.
				
				This film is stuffed with mind-expanding ideas, superb performances, spectacular action and scenery. The computer graphics are inevitable, these days, but they do conjure up powerful images. This is certainly one of the very best epics I have seen; and I'm astonished by the number of negative reviews.
